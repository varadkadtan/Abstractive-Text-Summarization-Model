# Abstractive-Text-Summarization-Model
I've built an abstractive text summarization model based on the T5 transformer in PyTorch. It's fine-tuned for creating concise summaries from long texts, utilizing transformer libraries and multi-head self-attention. It streamlines information extraction with human-like summaries.
